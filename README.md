## 🛠️ How to Run It Locally

1. **Clone the Repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EdunexusBackend-v2.git
   cd EdunexusBackend-v2/StudentLearningApp
Configure DB Connection
Edit the application.properties file:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/edunexus
spring.datasource.username=your_db_user
spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
Run the Backend

bash

./mvnw spring-boot:run
Test It
Use Postman or Swagger (optional) to test endpoints.

⚠️ Exception Handling & Edge Cases
🚫 Unauthorized access triggers secure redirects/responses

🔍 Course/Test not found → Custom error messages

❌ Invalid login credentials → Proper response codes

📌 Robust DTO validations prevent malformed requests

🌟 Why This Project Stands Out
✨ Designed with real-world architecture in mind

💡 Separates concerns smartly with DTOs, Entities, Controllers, and Repos

🔐 Includes security-first principles with protected admin areas

📈 Optimized for scalability and easy future expansion (e.g., JWT, Docker, Swagger, etc.)

🎯 Follows industry-standard best practices in naming, structure, and clarity

🔮 What Can Be Improved
Here’s how this backend could become a production-grade powerhouse:

✅ Add Swagger/OpenAPI for full API documentation

✅ Integrate JWT tokens for modern auth systems

✅ Add Unit & Integration Tests using JUnit + Mockito

✅ Build a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

✅ Add rate limiting and monitoring (e.g., Spring Actuator)
